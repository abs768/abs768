## Experience

**Software Engineer Intern** | Navitas Business Consulting  
*June 2024 - August 2024*

Built REST APIs for Arkansas state benefits portal (184K+ employees). Drove database migration from Flyway to Liquibase across teams. Implemented PostgreSQL triggers for automated audit logging. 85% test coverage with JUnit/Testcontainers, reduced prod bugs 60%.

**Deep Learning Apprentice** | NVIDIA Jetson AI Program  
*May 2022 - October 2022*

Optimized CNN for vehicle damage detection on edge devices. 87% accuracy, sub-100ms inference through TensorRT + FP16 quantization. Built hardware-accelerated pipeline with VPI. Profiled with Nsight Systems, eliminated CPU-GPU transfer bottlenecks.
